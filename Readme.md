# arch1-project3-lcd

This repository is for the computer architecture term project. For this
project you must create a toy that utilizes the LCD display to draw shapes,
the timer interrupts to update state over time, and buttons to change behavior.

Several demos are provided:
* 1_shape_demo draws some simple shapes
* 2_button_demo uses the buttons to update the display
* 3_moving_shapes uses timer interrupts to move shapes aroudn
* 4_wake_demo draws an hourglass and uses the buttons to change colors
